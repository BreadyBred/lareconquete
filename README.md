# La Reconquête: A Multi-faceted Commemoration of Joan of Arc

"La Reconquête" is an ambitious project developed during my first year of university studies, marking my introduction to the world of web design. This event, commemorating the legacy of Joan of Arc, will be held in Rouen, a pivotal location in her story. The project comprises several key components:

*   **Interactive Website:** An immersive website will offer visitors a deep dive into the medieval era.
*   **Captivating Trailer:** A trailer will be created to generate excitement and anticipation for the event.
*   **Historical Reenactment:** A spectacular reenactment of the historical battle against the English will be a central feature of the commemoration.
*   **360-Degree Communication Strategy:** A comprehensive communication plan will include:
    *   Impactful Posters
    *   Social Media Campaigns
    *   Media Partnerships

"La Reconquête" aims to revitalize collective memory and transmit Joan of Arc's historical legacy through a memorable and engaging experience, connecting the past with the present.
